# <p style="text-align: center;">Purpose:</p>

Eggformer is my project for the Board Games and RPG class, taught by Professor Salmo.

It also serves as a Git, Godot, and image manipulation practice.

Eggformer is supposed to be a simple platformer game with music, dangers, and challenges. Developed in Godot v4.1.3-stable.

### Sprites:

[GrafxKid](https://itch.io) - Various sprites in general.

[omniclause](https://omniclause.itch.io/spikes) - (spikes).

Other sprites used (e.g., mobile controls) are from other artists, but I lost the link :<

### Used Music:

## All music is used without permission. I still need to talk to the creators, and until permission is granted, the repository will not provide the game's music.
