# <p style="text-align: center;">Purpose:</p>

Eggformer is my project for the Board Games and RPG class, taught by Professor Salmo.

It also serves as a Git, Godot, and image manipulation practice.

Eggformer is supposed to be a simple platformer game with music, dangers, and challenges. Developed in Godot v4.1.3-stable.
